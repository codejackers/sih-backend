   1. An automated system for the HEIs / Universities to submit their updated Gazette notification / EoA / approval letter along with current intake capacity of the approved courses / programmes 
   2. Stakeholder can browse the University / HEIs approval status including offering courses / intake capacity and admission procedures A gateway for stakeholders to choose a correct institute for taking admission or other purposes.
